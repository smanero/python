# Python

Previous year and this 2021 i,ve been learning ML and data science. As my skills in Python were zero, i have used this project to learn some basics.

### Licensing

Not very sure how to share this code, as is not software on its own, as mainly exercises to practice different libraries and aspects of this programming language.

## Basics

In this directory some samples of the most common uses of Python (file managament, mongodb access, json basics) are coded. Most of them are obtained from www.w3cschool.org

## Frontend

This is a Future<directory> where as soon as possible i want to learn django and develop a mp3 player/organiser.

## Webscrapping

Learning python, references to data obtained from internet are often found. So i have done some research and practice exercises in order to learn a shor how-to. In the web-s-py directory, different .py archives are found with scrapping, more o less functional, of some webs.

Most of them are based in BeautyfulSoup library. License:

## Machine Learning

Another Future<directory> where i intend to summarize all i learn about python libraries related with this area. Nowadays i work mainly with jupiter notebooks, from anaconda 3, and i wouldn,t like to mix them with a pure python module.
